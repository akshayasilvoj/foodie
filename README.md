# Fresh Cuisine
> This restaurant project is from [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and it is a SPA (single-page application) website. The user can navigate between the home, menu and contact page, and can choose between menu categories from the dropdown list.  I used the MealDB API to display some menu items.
